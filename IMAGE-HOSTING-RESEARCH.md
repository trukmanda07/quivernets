### 2. Cloudflare R2 Storage

**Best for**: High-traffic sites needing unlimited bandwidth without egress fees

- **Pricing**:
  - Storage: $15/TB/month
  - Egress: $0 (FREE - this is the key advantage!)

  - Globally uniform pricing
- **Cons**:
  - No built-in image transformation/resizing

### 3. Cloudflare Images

**Best for**: Sites needing automatic image transformations and variants

- **Pricing**:
  - $5 per 100,000 images stored
  - $1 per 100,000 images delivered

  - Good for creating image variants
- **Cons**:
  - More expensive than R2 alone if you don't need transformations

## Recommendation Matrix

### For QuiverNets.com (Educational Platform)

| Scenario | Recommended Solution | Reasoning |
|----------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Quick Start (Best Overall)** | **Vercel or Netlify** | Zero config, automatic deployment from Git, built-in image optimization, free tier sufficient for educational content |
| **High Traffic Expected** | **Cloudflare R2** | No egress fees = unlimited bandwidth at fixed cost |
| **Need Advanced Features** | **Cloudinary** | 25GB free tier, AI transformations, video support |
| **Already Have cPanel** | **cPanel + Build Upload** | Simplest if hosting is already paid for |
| **Budget Conscious** | **Vercel/Netlify Free Tier** | 100GB/month free bandwidth, automatic optimization |

---

## Specific Recommendation for QuiverNets

### Option A: Vercel/Netlify (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)

**Why?**
1. **Git-based workflow**: Push code → automatic deployment
2. **Zero configuration**: Astro's `<Image>` component works automatically
3. **Free tier**: 100GB bandwidth is plenty for educational content
4. **Performance**: Global CDN included
5. **Developer experience**: Best DX with preview deployments

**Setup Steps**:
```bash
# Install adapter
npm install @astrojs/vercel

# Update astro.config.mjs
import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/static';

export default defineConfig({
  // ... existing config
  output: 'static',
  adapter: vercel({
    imageService: true,
  }),
});

# Deploy
git push origin main
```

**Images**: Store locally in `src/assets/` → Vercel/Netlify optimizes automatically

---

### Option B: Keep it Simple with cPanel

**When to choose?**
- You already have cPanel hosting for quivernets.com
- Prefer manual control
- Low traffic site (< 10GB/month)

**Workflow**:
1. Develop locally
2. `npm run build`
3. Upload `dist/` folder to `public_html/`
4. Images are automatically included in build

**Images**: Store in `src/assets/` → Astro optimizes during build → upload to cPanel

---

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (For Future Scaling)

**Strategy**: Start with Vercel/Netlify, later move high-traffic images to R2

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy entire site to Vercel/Netlify (free tier)
2. **Phase 2**: If traffic exceeds 100GB/month:
   - Move frequently accessed images to Cloudflare R2
   - Configure Astro to use remote images
   - Keep static site on Vercel/Netlify

---

## Implementation Examples

### Local Images (Current Approach - Works Everywhere)

```astro
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import heroImage from '../assets/blog-placeholder-1.jpg';
---

<Image
  src={heroImage}
  alt="Blog post"
  width={1020}
  height={510}
  quality={85}
  format="webp"
  loading="lazy"
/>
```

### Remote Images (Cloudflare R2 / Firebase / Cloudinary)

```astro
---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
---

<Image
  src="https://your-r2-bucket.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/blog-image.jpg"
  alt="Blog post"
  width={1020}
  height={510}
  inferSize
/>
```

**Note**: Requires configuring `image.domains` in `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
export default defineConfig({
  image: {
    domains: ["your-r2-bucket.r2.cloudflarestorage.com"],
  },
});
```
